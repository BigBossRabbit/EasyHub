description: Global git workflow for status, add, commit, and push

# Git Workflow

This workflow provides a quick sequence of Git commands that can be run globally to manage repository changes without manual typing each command.

1. **Status** – View current repository status:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
2. **Add** – Stage all changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
3. **Commit** – Commit with a message (replace `<message>` with your commit description):
   ```sh
   git commit -m "<message>"
   ```
4. **Push (optional)** – Push commits to the remote repository:
   ```sh
   git push
   ```
